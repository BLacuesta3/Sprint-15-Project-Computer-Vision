In this project I will use ResNet 50 and an Image Data Generator in order to create a neural network model that can predict customers' real ages based on customer images/ photos.  This project also includes an EDA section that consists of histograms that display the distribution of customers according age and a section in which I verify the accuracy of customer ages based on photos from the dataset.

    "The national supermarket chain Good Seed is exploring how Data Science can help ensure compliance with regulations related to the sale of over-the-counter cough syrup, which can contain ingredients that are regulated due to potential misuse. Specifically, they want to prevent sales to individuals under the legal purchase age.\n",
    "Your task is to evaluate whether a computer vision model can help automate age verification at checkout. As you take on this task, consider the following:\n",
    "● Checkout areas are equipped with cameras that capture images when someone attempts to purchase OTC cough syrup.\n",
    "● Computer vision techniques can be used to estimate a person’s age from these images.\n",
    "● Your job is to build and evaluate a model that predicts age from photos to assist in OTC medication compliance.\n",
    "To help you get started, you’ll be provided with a dataset of facial images annotated with age labels."
