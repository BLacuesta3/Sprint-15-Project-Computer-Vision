Project Title: Sprint 15 Project/ Computer Vision

Project Description:


This project applies computer vision and deep learning techniques to solve a regression task for the Good Seed company. The goal is to build a neural network model capable of predicting a customer’s real age using only their image.

Using a pretrained ResNet-50 architecture combined with an ImageDataGenerator pipeline, the model learns to extract facial features and estimate age with continuous numerical output.

The project includes:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Histograms showing the distribution of customer ages

Visual verification of customer age labels based on sample images

Model Development:

Transfer learning with ResNet-50

Data augmentation and preprocessing with ImageDataGenerator

Training and evaluation of a deep learning regression model for age prediction

This work demonstrates the effectiveness of convolutional neural networks in solving real-world image-based regression problems.
